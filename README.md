# 🌟 Data Structure Visualization in JFrame

## 📜 Project Description

This project is a Java-based application that provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing and performing operations on various data structures. The application is implemented using JFrame and includes the following data structures:

- 📋 Array
- 🥞 Stack
- 🚶 Queue
- 🔄 Circular Queue
- 🔗 Linked List

---

## ✨ Features

### 1. Data Structure Implementations

- **📋 Array**:
  - Takes size, index, and a number as inputs.
  - Supports the following operations:
    - ➕ Insert: Add a number at a specified index.
    - ❌ Delete: Remove a number from a specified index.
    - 📈 Sort: Sort the array in ascending order.
    - 🔍 Search: Find the index of a specified number.
    - 👀 Display: View the entire array content.
- **🥞 Stack**:
  - Takes size as input.
  - Supports the following operations:
    - ➕ Push: Add a number to the stack.
    - ➖ Pop: Remove the top number from the stack.
    - 👀 Display: View all elements in the stack.
- **🚶 Queue**:
  - Takes size as input.
  - Supports the following operations:
    - ➕ Insert: Add a number to the queue.
    - ❌ Delete: Remove a number from the front of the queue.
    - 👀 Display: View all elements in the queue.
- **🔄 Circular Queue**:
  - Takes size as input.
  - Supports the following operations:
    - ➕ Enqueue: Add a number to the circular queue.
    - ➖ Dequeue: Remove a number from the circular queue.
    - 👀 Display: View all elements in the circular queue.
- **🔗 Linked List**:
  - Created upon clicking a button.
  - Supports the following operations:
    - 🔄 Insert First: Add a node at the beginning.
    - ➕ Insert Last: Add a node at the end.
    - ❌ Delete First: Remove the first node.
    - ➖ Delete Last: Remove the last node.
    - 👀 Display: View all nodes in the linked list.

### 2. Graphical User Interface
